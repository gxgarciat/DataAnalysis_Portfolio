# DataAnalysis_Portfolio
A showcase of projects using Python, Pandas, Numpy, datasets and mathematical models.

## [Project 1: Movie Box Office](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/1_MovieBoxOffice_LinRegression.ipynb)
* This project was developed using a *.csv file.
* It comprised the data cleaning, importing it with Pandas, obtaining features by using descriptive statistics.
* A Linear Regression model was prepared to estimate Production Budget VS Worlwide Gross, in [USD].
* A snapshot of the estimation model is presented below:

## [Project 2: Analysis of the Access to electricity in Latin America](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/2_ElectLatam.ipynb)
* This project was developed using a real dataset from https://databank.worldbank.org/.
* It comprised the data cleaning, importing it with Pandas, obtaining features by using descriptive statistics.
* Several individual countries were analysed.
* A comparison of the access to electricity in 2008 and 2011 was carried out. This is to compare this as a Development Indicator.
* A snapshot of the comparison models is presented below:

## [Project 3: Gradient Descent Implementation](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/3_Gradient%20descent.ipynb)
* This project was developed using this optimization tool.
* A simple cost function (quadratic function) was selected to evaluate its use.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including the local minimum.
* A snapshot of this study is presented below:

## [Project 4: Gradient Descent - Quartic Function](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/4_Multiple_minima_Initial_Guess.ipynb)
* This project was developed using this optimization tool.
* A more complex cost function (Quartic function) was selected to evaluate its use. The complexity is because this function has Multiple minima.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including the minima.
* A snapshot of this study is presented below:

## [Project 5: Gradient Descent - Quintic Function](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/5_Divergence_Overflow_Tuples.ipynb)
* This project was developed using this optimization tool.
* A more complex cost function (Quintic function) was selected to evaluate its use. The complexity is because this function has Multiple minima.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including the effect learning rate. A snapshot of this is shown below:

## [Project 6: Data Visualization](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/6_DataVisualization_3D_PartialDerivatives.ipynb)
* This project was developed using similar optimization tools.
* A more complex cost function (3D surface) was selected to evaluate its use.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including calculus. A snapshot of this is shown below:

## [Project 7: Mean Squared Error](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/7_MeanSquaredError.ipynb)
* This project used to evaluate the Mean Squared error.
* A more complex cost function (3D surface) was selected to evaluate its use.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including the Partial Derivatives of MSE. A snapshot of this is shown below:

## [Project 8: House Price Analysis - Boston](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/8_HousePriceData_MultivariableRegression.ipynb)
* This project uses a dataset from a paper regarding the house prices in the Boston Area. Although the article is dated, it shows the influence of different factors regarding the price of the houses (closeness to school, closeness to river, etc.).
* A complete analysis of the different variables is carried out, including stadistics.
* A multivariable regression was carried out as well, among other studies. A snapshot of these are shown below:

## [Project 9: Valuation Tool](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/9_Valuation_Tool.ipynb)
* This project uses the data provided from the previous study.
* It uses the function: get_dollar_estimate, the variables number of rooms, numer of students per teacher, closeness to the river and the prediction interval.
* At the end, a mathematical model is implemented and the estimated property value is obtained.
