# DataAnalysis_Portfolio
A showcase of projects using Python, Pandas, Numpy, datasets and mathematical models.

## [Project 1: Movie Box Office](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/1_MovieBoxOffice_LinRegression.ipynb)
* This project was developed using a *.csv file.
* It comprised the data cleaning, importing it with Pandas, obtaining features by using descriptive statistics.
* A Linear Regression model was prepared to estimate Production Budget VS Worlwide Gross, in [USD].
* A snapshot of the estimation model is presented below:

## [Project 2: Analysis of the Access to electricity in Latin America](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/2_ElectLatam.ipynb)
* This project was developed using a real dataset from https://databank.worldbank.org/.
* It comprised the data cleaning, importing it with Pandas, obtaining features by using descriptive statistics.
* Several individual countries were analysed.
* A comparison of the access to electricity in 2008 and 2011 was carried out. This is to compare this as a Development Indicator.
* A snapshot of the estimation model is presented below:
