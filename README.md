# DataAnalysis_Portfolio
A showcase of projects using Python, Pandas, Numpy, datasets and mathematical models.

## [Project 1: Movie Box Office](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/1_MovieBoxOffice_LinRegression.ipynb)
* This project was developed using a *.csv file.
* It comprised the data cleaning, importing it with Pandas, obtaining features by using descriptive statistics.
* A Linear Regression model was prepared to estimate Production Budget VS Worlwide Gross, in [USD].
* A snapshot of the estimation model is presented below:

## [Project 2: Analysis of the Access to electricity in Latin America](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/2_ElectLatam.ipynb)
* This project was developed using a real dataset from https://databank.worldbank.org/.
* It comprised the data cleaning, importing it with Pandas, obtaining features by using descriptive statistics.
* Several individual countries were analysed.
* A comparison of the access to electricity in 2008 and 2011 was carried out. This is to compare this as a Development Indicator.
* A snapshot of the comparison models is presented below:

## [Project 3: Gradient Descent Implementation](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/3_Gradient%20descent.ipynb)
* This project was developed using this optimization tool.
* A simple cost function (quadratic function) was selected to evaluate its use.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including the local minimum.
* A snapshot of this study is presented below:

## [Project 4: Gradient Descent - Quartic Function](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/4_Multiple_minima_Initial_Guess.ipynb)
* This project was developed using this optimization tool.
* A more complex cost function (Quartic function) was selected to evaluate its use. The complexity is because this function has Multiple minima.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including the minima.
* A snapshot of this study is presented below:

## [Project 5: Gradient Descent - Quintic Function](https://github.com/gxgarciat/Playground-DataAnalysis/blob/main/5_Divergence_Overflow_Tuples.ipynb)
* This project was developed using this optimization tool.
* A more complex cost function (Quintic function) was selected to evaluate its use. The complexity is because this function has Multiple minima.
* A mathematical analysis was carried out, including the effect learning rate. A snapshot of this is shown below:
